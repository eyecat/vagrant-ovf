README

The idea comes from https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/322

Basically, the code is much similar with the one here(https://gist.github.com/1332279), but I spent some time to convert it to be a vagrant plugin.

To Use the plugin, you just need to install the gem like:
gem install vagrant-ovf

After that, you can invoke the plugin like:
vagrant ovf [box_name]

With the plugin, the box.ovf & box.mf will be updated to be compatible with VMWare and potential OVA.

To make a OVF archive, you can install ovftool from VMWare and invoke the following command:
ovftool ~/.vagrant.box/boxes/[box_name]/box.ovf /tmp/[box_name].ova
or
ovftool ~/.vagrant.box/boxes/[box_name]/box.ovf /tmp/[box_name].vmx

Tha latter command will generate a VMWare openable archive under /tmp, and you can open it with VMWare Fusion.
